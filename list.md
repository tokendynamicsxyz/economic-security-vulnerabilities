|10/11/2023| Synthetify DAO| Solana|Governance Exploit|Upgradeable Contract| A combination of a low threshold to pass DAO proposals, a largely inactive DAO, and low token price made the exploit easy for the exploiter to drain the treasury of the protocol.  The exploiter purchased the minimum amount of tokens needed to guarentee an approved proposal (~$4000 USD or 1.25% of the total circulating supply of the token) and pushed a malicious proposal to give them the ability to send DAO treasury funds to themselves.  The previous approved vote passed uncontested and with 1% (the minimum threshold) and the exploiter did a test run proposal that was uncontested and followed through with the exploit.|$230k |$230k| [https://blockworks.co/news/solana-exploit-dao-hacker/](https://blockworks.co/news/solana-exploit-dao-hacker/)
